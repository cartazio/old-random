for more info, read the IEEE 2008 Floating point spec or wikipedia.
single precision float is also called binary32,
double precision is also called binary64

the greatest negative exponent for double precision normalized floats is -1023, and
    53 bits after the implicit MSB of the significand
for single precision its -126,
  and

in both cases, for normalized form (exponent != 0, theres an implicit leading 1)


likewise, the exponent component of a floating point number is "biased"
in the sense of being an unsigned integer, with an additive positive correction factor
to map the actual exponent to its representation. To map from representation to value,
subtract the bias constant

binary32 bias == 127
binary64 bias == 1023

{- |  sampleUnitIntervalDoubleM uniformly samples over the [+0,1) interval  of
representable floating point numbers.

The underlying algorithm here is structured
as sampling from the dyadic (binary) representation  of real numbers in the [0,1)
interval, rounded to the nearest representable double precision floating point number.

Note that this sampling strategy can be adapted to the interval [0,1] by sampling one more bit
after this algorithm and rounding the sampled double up one ulp or leaving it unchanged, in
accordance with a choice in rounding strategy for floating point numbers such as round ties to even.

In such an extension,

{- | sampleUnitIntervalDouble52BitM, using the same algorithm as in
http://xoroshiro.di.unimi.it/#remarks, which is also used by the rand package
in rust. It has issues, but its super fast. Generates all the representable floats
the correspond to dyadic (binary) rationals of the form k/2^{âˆ’53}. Note that
the lowest order bit will be 0.

Which is why (in the haskell implementation) the lowest order bit  of the random word
is then xor'd against the corrected unit interval number in this specific implementation!
(the lowest order bit is otherwise always 0).

NB: some of the notes mention using floating point multiplication
and division and imply that this strategy, rather than the bit fiddling one,
will have full 53 bit rep. need to check this.


extracted docs from the original site:
"""
   #include <stdint.h>

    (x >> 11) * (1. / (UINT64_C(1) << 53))
This conversion guarantees that all dyadic rationals of the form k / 2^53 will be equally likely. Note that this conversion prefers the high bits of x, but you can alternatively use the lowest bits.

An alternative, faster multiplication-free operation is

    #include <stdint.h>

    static inline double to_double(uint64_t x) {
       const union { uint64_t i; double d; } u = { .i = UINT64_C(0x3FF) << 52 | x >> 12 };
       return u.d - 1.0;
    }
The code above cooks up by bit manipulation a real number in the interval [1..2), and then subtracts one to obtain a real number in the interval [0..1). If x is chosen uniformly among 64-bit integers, d is chosen uniformly among dyadic rationals of the form k / 2^52.
